# What's the point of data structures?

We want a computer to do some useful computation. A computation is an algorithm, which is 
"a finite sequence of rigorous instructions" [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm). 

Typically, we want to run a set of instructions to tell us something about information (data) we already have.
We might also want to transform that data to yield new or modified data.

That's where data structures come into play. Data structures say how can I organize my data to 
allow me to write the most efficient (i.e., fast completing) set of instructions. 

# How do we talk about data structures 

In computer science, there is often a distinction made between interface (operations / abstract data type) 
and implementation (algorithms and internal representation of data needed for operations).

# Common interfaces

| Type      | Note      |
|-----------|-----------|
| List (includes Stack, Deque, Queue) | Sequence indexed by 0,1,2,...,n-1, implementations change behavior for adding or removing from the list |
| Unordered Sets (includes Dictionaries, Maps) | Distinct elements in no particular order |
| Sorted Sets | Provides ability to compare elements to determine ordering, find(x) more meaningful as you say find smallest y such that y >= x. Return y or null if does not exist. Slower runtime on find though versus Unsorted|

# Mathematical background (ðŸ¤“)

These notes are brief. If there is time, in the future, could be good to look through [this](https://people.csail.mit.edu/meyer/mcs.pdf). Have not 
yet had time to do so, but found based on citations for this book and a quick web search.

## Exponents, Logarithms, and Factorials

For some positive integer $b$, we can say that $b^x = b \times b \times \cdots \times b$ 
where the right hand side has $b$ $x$ times. 

$b^0 = 1$

$b^x = \frac{1}{b^{-x}}$

 Things called out like this are thoughts (i.e., my own commentary).
 Might think of log as scaling down whereas exponent scales up (probably should research that claim more...).

$x = log_bk$ means $x$ is the "base-$b$ logarithm of $k$". 

In other $b^x = k$. 

Informally, $x$ says how many times can we divide $k$ by $b$ until
the result is less than or equal to 1.

The natural log $log_e =$ ln$k$.

$e = \lim \ n \to \infty \ (1+\frac{1}{n})^n$ 

Care about ln$k$ because solves integral for $\frac{1}{x}dx$ 
from 1 to $k$. 


Exponents and logarithms deal with scaling, and we can use Factorials
for counting.

For a non-negative integer $n$, $n! = 1 \dot 2 \dot 3 \cdots n$. 

This gives the number of distinct orderings (i.e., permutations) of n elements.

If instead we wanted to say how many subsets can we make from $n$ of size $k$, we can
do $n$ choose $k$ to get a binomial coefficient. 

$\binom(n,k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)}$. 

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’­">
$n$ choose $k$ is smaller than permutations of $n$, which
seems to imply problems asking you to create subsets of a list 
might be faster than determining all orderings of a list's elements...not sure 
if true but intuitively would think so. Picking groups of apples seems less tedious then ordering 
apples...
