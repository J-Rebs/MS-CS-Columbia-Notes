# What's the point of data structures?

We want a computer to do some useful computation. A computation is an algorithm, which is 
"a finite sequence of rigorous instructions" [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm). 

Typically, we want to run a set of instructions to tell us something about information (data) we already have.
We might also want to transform that data to yield new or modified data.

That's where data structures come into play. Data structures say how can I organize my data to 
allow me to write the most efficient (i.e., fast completing) set of instructions. 

# How do we talk about data structures 

In computer science, there is often a distinction made between interface (operations) 
and implementation (algorithms and internal representation of data needed for operations).
