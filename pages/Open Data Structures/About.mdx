# What's included here? 

A selected review of the content in the [OpenDataStructures](http://opendatastructures.org/)
textbook by Pat Morin. Where other sources are used, they are cited.

Some of the content structure may be inspired by [AlgoExpert](https://www.algoexpert.io/data-structures), but
all content is from free/open-source references. 

# Why make this? 

I learn by narrative, so I wanted to keep a record of data structures notes in my own words
while gradually preparing for job interviews. Also I have some strong areas in computer science,
but I need to strengthen some of my core data structures knowledge. This seemed like a good way to do it. 

# Is all the information included accurate? 

Not necessarily. While I hope to be accurate, if you see something wrong, please let me know. Also, if you would like to 
contribute or collaborate on these notes, please reach out. 

# Which sections are complete? 

I'll try to mark overall sections as done with a callout like the one below. 

<Callout emoji="✔️">
 This section is complete at least in an initial form. Updates may be added without notice.

<Callout emoji="💭">
 Things called out like this are thoughts (i.e., my own commentary). There's not always
 a clear line between between commentary and synthesis of the source textbook.
