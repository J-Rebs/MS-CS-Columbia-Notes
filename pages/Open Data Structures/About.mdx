# What's included here? 

A selected review of the content in the [OpenDataStructures](http://opendatastructures.org/)
textbook by Pat Morin. Where other sources are used, they are cited.

Some of the content structure may be inspired by [AlgoExpert](https://www.algoexpert.io/data-structures), but
all content is from free/open-source references. 

# Why make this? 

I learn by narrative, so I wanted to keep a record of data structures notes in my own words
while gradually preparing for job interviews. Also I have some strong areas in computer science,
but I need to strengthen some of my core data structures knowledge. This seemed like a good way to do it. 

# Is all the information included accurate? 

Not necessarily. While I hope to be accurate, if you see something wrong, please let me know. Also, if you would like to 
contribute or collaborate on these notes, please reach out. 

# Which sections are complete? 

I'll try to mark overall sections as done with a callout like the one below.

 This section is complete at least in an initial form. Updates may be added without notice.

## Exponents and Logarithms

For some positive integer $b$, we can say that $b^x = b \times b \times \cdots \times b$ 
where the right hand side has $b$ $x$ times. 

$b^0 = 1$

$b^x = \frac{1}{b^{-x}}$

 Things marked with the 💭 are thought emojis. They are commentary from me, and not necessarily meant to be a summary from the open data structures book.
 When I first read the below, in the book, I was like oh, right that's a logarithm. I often think of using logarithms to `scale things down`, but I 
 use them so much without thinking, I can forget the base definition! It's a good reminder to go back to the basics, and it's cool too. 

 In a way, maybe exponents scale things up, while logs scale them down (I'm sure there is something suspect in that statement, but it's interesting to think about).

$x = log_{b}k$ means x is the "base-b logarithm of k". 

In other $b^x = k$. 

Informally, x says how many times can we divide k by b until
the result is less than or equal to 1.

The natural log $log_{e} =$ ln$k$. 

$e = \lim(1+\frac{1}{n})^n$

Care about ln$k$ because solves integral for $\frac{1}{x}dx$ 
from 1 to $k$.
