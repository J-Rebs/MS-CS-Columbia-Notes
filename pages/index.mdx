# What is this website for?

This website is a non-exhaustive list of notes related to official coursework, research,
and unofficial courses while I have been at Columbia University for the [Bridge to MS](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/ms-bridge/) and
[MS in CS](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/education/ms/).

The notes should be considered a work in progress with periodic updates. 
If a note section is not being updated any longer, I will try, but cannot guarantee to mark it as such.

These notes may contain inaccuracies, so use them at your own risk. If you see something wrong 
you would me to fix or have another topic you think would be interesting to add, feel free to reach out to me.

# How was this website built?
