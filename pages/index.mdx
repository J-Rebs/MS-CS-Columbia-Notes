# What is this website for?

This website is a non-exhaustive list of notes related to my out of class studies while I have been at Columbia University for the [Bridge to MS](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/ms-bridge/) and
[MS in CS](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/education/ms/). It's my own supplement to the courses completed. 

The notes should be considered a work in progress with periodic updates. 
If a note section is not being updated any longer, I will try, but cannot guarantee to mark it as such.

These notes may contain inaccuracies, so use them at your own risk. If you see something wrong or would like to contribute, please reach out to me.

# How was this website built?

This website was built with **Nextra**, which is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) based static site generator.
It is deployed with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs). The GitHub logo at the top of this page will take you to Nextra's repository.
